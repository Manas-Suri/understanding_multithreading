# Rust Multithreaded State Management

## Overview

This project is a Rust implementation of a multithreaded system that utilizes interfaces and state equations. The goal is to demonstrate how to manage states and interfaces efficiently in a concurrent environment, leveraging Rust's powerful concurrency features.

## Features

- **Interfaces**: Define clear contracts for state management.
- **State Equations**: Implement mathematical models to represent system states.
- **Multithreading**: Utilize Rust's threading capabilities to handle multiple states concurrently.
- **Safety**: Take advantage of Rust's ownership model to ensure memory safety and prevent data races.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) (comes with Rust)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manas-Suri/understanding_multithreading.git
   cd understanding_multithreading
   ```
